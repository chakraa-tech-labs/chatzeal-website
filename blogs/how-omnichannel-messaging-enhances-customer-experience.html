She then decides to proceed to checkout on your website to buy the product, however she encounters an issue during the checkout process. She quickly reaches out to your customer support via Whatsapp. Your agent is able to resolve the issue promptly because he has full context of the customer’s interactions throughout the buying journey.

                    <div class="blog-details-text-content">
                        As a business, have you also encountered the terms - Multi-channel messaging and cross-channel messaging in addition to omni-channel messaging and thought if all these are similar? Though these terms may seem similar, all the three represent different levels of integration and experience through the communication channels.
                    </div>
                    <div class="blog-details-text-content">
                        Multi-channel messaging is where a business uses several separate communication channels like social media, email, phone support, to bring a product or service to a customer. Offering different channels implies there are different ways of making contact. But these sales channels are not connected and are organized independently. For example, customers can contact your business from your social media ad campaign or from your in-app live chat but the communication or the information cannot be continued across the channels. This requires each of your team to analyze different data for each channel.
                    </div>
                    <div class="blog-details-text-content">
                        Cross-channel messaging links multiple channels but does not offer a fully seamless experience. There might still be gaps in the flow of information across the channels, meaning not all the channels are fully aware of the customer interactions. For example, You send a promotional discount code to your customer via SMS, that can be availed on a purchase from your website. However, when the customer contacts you through your in-app live chat support because the code is not applying, if your support team is unaware of the SMS interaction, this gap in the information flow hinders the customer experience.
