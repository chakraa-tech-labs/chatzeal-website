Broadcast lists are a saved list of contacts that allows businesses to message a large group of customers at a given time. Create a curated broadcast list to send messages to a selected group of customers. All of these contacts can receive your messages until your phone number is saved in their phone’s contacts. Unlike the group chats, broadcast lists keep conversations one on one.

                                                    WhatsApp status update is a powerful marketing tool that can significantly enhance your business’s marketing strategies and boost customer engagement. WhatsApp status allows you to share time sensitive content such as announcements, updates, offers, and promotional content that remain visible for 24 hours since uploaded. You can use text, incorporate images, videos and URL to make it more engaging and help deliver visually compelling content to your audience. This feature allows you to keep your customers informed without being overly intrusive by not sending them direct messages. Status updates are prominently displayed in the app to catch the attention of the user thereby increasing the chances for the user to view the status. By including call to actions such as encouraging your customers to message you for more details or ask queries, you can create a more engaging experience.

The catalog feature in WhatsApp Business allows you to showcase your offerings to your customers. However, businesses using WhatsApp Business API often find the native Catalog and Payment features limited. To enhance their e-commerce capabilities, they integrate with dedicated e-commerce platforms like Shopify to manage their products and streamline transactions at scale. In some countries like Brazil, Singapore and India WhatsApp Business enables businesses to send payment requests or links on chat through which your customers can directly make payment to you securely from within WhatsApp. Both the parties receive the transaction details in the chat. And for the regions where WhatsApp does not currently support the in-built payment processing feature, it enables you to integrate with your trusted third-party payment providers or share the payment link. This allows the customers to make their payment through their trusted platform which streamlines the check out process.
