                                For instance, a customer intrigued by a promotional offer, proceeds to enquire more information about the service. If they encounter delayed responses or are forced to navigate between multiple channels, automated options and repetitive processes, their excitement quickly turns to frustration. This frustration can drive them away, in favor of a competitor offering a more seamless experience. This scenario underscores a disconnect between what businesses expect and what customers are actually seeking. A

                                Traditionally, marketing involved one-sided communication, with brands pushing messages through TV, radio, and newspapers then through emails and digital ads. The interaction between a brand and a customer had been minimal to none, and not real-time. According to a report by Sendoso, 80% of consumers are fatigued with virtual engagement efforts. Businesses are starting to realize that uninspired messages can hinder customer satisfaction and can bring down the brand’s loyalty over time. Sending out sporadic messages without a proper strategy and hoping for the best will not help gain the trust of your customers. This means it is time to evolve from transactional notifications to conversational messaging.

Conventional methods of communication often fall short in catering to these requirements. But this is where conversational messaging comes into play to help the businesses in shifting the focus from talking at customers to talking with customers.

                                                    86% of consumers prefer to interact with a human agent; 71% said they would be less likely to use a brand if it didn’t have human customer service representatives available.

This approach combines the speed of automation with the empathy of human agents to provide exceptional customer support.
